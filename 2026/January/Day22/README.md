morning solved a two pointer problem

leetcode 167 two sum 2 question 
where the given  array is in sorted order
i have done this in 2 approaches where using the binary search approach tc:O(nlogn)
two pointer approach with O(n)
maintaining the left and right pointers 
right at the end of the array.


solved the leetcode 76th question while watching the strivers video 
most of the logic was my own but it will give the tc of o(n^2)
after watching the maintaining the counter i grasped the  logic
